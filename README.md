# FMOD Unity - Event / GUID Swapper

## Description

This FMOD patch will add a "Swap" button to [FMODUnity.EventRef] property which facilitates swapping Event Path with the more robust GUID.
Patch has been tested and verified in **FMOD Version 2.00.08 up to 2.01.07.**.

### Starting from FMOD 2.02.00 you won't need this patch anymore if you set your Event Linkage to GUID! :heart_eyes:
